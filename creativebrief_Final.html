</ol>
<h2>2. Overview </h2>
<ol>
<li><h4>What is the project?</h4></li>
<ul><li>Website Redesign</ul></li>
<li><h4>What are we designing and why?</h4></li>
<ul><li>Redesigning the client’s website to update it’s layout, visuals and links so
it is up to date with current information and trends, and overall make it
more functional and appealing to use.</ul></li>
<li><h4>What opportunities are we trying to take advantage of?</h4></li>
<ul><li>The current trend of “vintage” that is attracting people to “older” types of
entertainment, and the possibility of expanding the client’s reach to the
younger generation.</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3>3. Drivers</h3>
<ol>
<li><h4>What is our goal for this project?</h4></li>
<ul><li>Redesign the website so it is functional and visually appealing</ul></li>
<li><h4>What are our top three objectives?</h4></li>
<ul><li>Modernize and completely overhaul the site.</ul></li>
<ul><li>Create a working site for both desktop and mobile that retain features
regardless of platform.</ul></li>
<ul><li>Bolster attention to The Pocket Sandwich Theatre with new and working
website features.</ul></li>
<li><h4>How long would the project take?</h4></li>
<ul><li>13 weeks</ul></li>
<li><h4>How long until the client should expect to meet the above-mentioned goals?</h4></li>
<ul><li>13 weeks to modernize and redo the website, and 6 months to a year to
gain a 10% larger follower base, depending on how well the Pocket
Sandwich team markets and advertises their new website.</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2>4. Audience</h2>
<ol>
<li><h4>Who’s our target audience?</h4></li>
<ul><li>Anyone who enjoys a good live performance and theatre arts</ul></li>
<li><h4>What do they think of us?</h4></li>
<ul><li>They’re fun and offer good service and entertainment for the price. It’s
enjoyable to come and eat there and watch the shows.</ul></li>
<li><h4>Why should they care?</h4></li>
<ul><li>Pocket Sandwich Theatre is a family friendly one of a kind attraction,
classical in the very verbiage of the word theatre. In the current
monotonous state of the world during the tragedy that is COVID-19 we
believe that Pocket Sandwich Theatre can provide a “new” but familiar
way to experience both tragedy and comedy through the visceral
escapism that is live theatre. Embrace tradition, reject modernality.</ul></li>
<li><h4>Be specific, provide information such as age, gender, race, income level,
education level, etc.</h4></li>
<ul><li>Very open and can be appealing to people of all backgrounds regardless
of age, gender, race and education level.</ul></li>
<ul><li>Because dinner services are not included in the ticket price, income level
may play a factor in who comes in. Ticket prices are more expensive than
other entertainment options, such as regular cinema which may be more
appealing to people on tighter budgets. As a result, those with a lower
income may fall out of the range of the target audience.</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2>5. Competitors </h2>
<ol>
<li><h4>Who is the competition (small and large)?</h4></li>
<ul><li>Small- Other local theaters, including schools, or drive-ins. For food, local
restaurants.</ul></li>
<ul><li>Large- Corporate movie theatres or places with large-scale theatre
productions (such as Bass Hall). Fast food or corporate restaurants.</ul></li>
<li><h4>What are they telling the audience that WE should also be telling them?</h4></li>
<ul><li>Their tagline is “The most fun you can have in a Dallas Theatre,” which I
feel is something that is important to emphasize in their website as well.
This is a place where you can have a fun night, eat good food, and
interact and grow in the DFW community.</ul></li>
<li><h4>What makes us different and unique compared to our competitors?</h4></li>
<ul><li>We’re interactive, fun and casual, we have award-winning shows and
actors, and we pride ourselves in supporting local actors and playwrights.</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2>6. Tone</h2>
<ol>
<li><h4>What tone should we use to communicate to our target audience? Why?</h4></li>
<ul><li>Our tone should be lighthearted and casual, but with just a touch of
professionalism. We want to keep the overall theme of the theatre and its
fun-oriented experience intact. However, we would also like to add a more
professional tone as well to better convey that Pocket Sandwich is a
legitimate business/ competition.</ul></li>
<li><h4>What adjectives describe the feeling we are trying to project or our approach?</h4></li>
<ul><li>The feelings that we are trying to project could be described as
impassioned, fun-loving, lighthearted, and friendly.</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2>7. Message </h2>
<ol>
<li><h4>What are we saying with this piece exactly?</h4></li>
<ul><li>Our message is “come to Pocket Sandwich and you’ll have a fun,
interactive time, watch an amazing show, and eat good food.”</ul></li>
<li><h4>Are the words already developed or do we need to develop them?</h4></li>
<ul><li>The feeling is developed and a lot of the words are there, but it needs to
be developed into a cohesive message.</ul></li>
<li><h4>What do we want audiences to take away?</h4></li>
<ul><li>We want our audience to take away that we’re a fun, rich in history
theatre that has tasty food, entertaining shows, and will give them a more
enjoyable experience than they can get anywhere else.</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2>8. Visuals</h2>
<ol>
<li><h4>Are we developing new images or picking up existing ones?</h4></li>
<ul><li>We can use old images in terms of what happens in the theatre, however,
when it comes to vector art and design outside the realm of photography
we may have to update the very dated design.</ul></li>
<li><h4>If we are creating them, who / what / where are we photographing or illustrating?
And why?</h4></li>
<ul><li>We would take brand new pictures in the theatre with guests along with
new disease preventative measures, and with new graphic design create
new logos, banners, and icons for the site.</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2>9. Details </h2>
<ol>
<li><h4>Is there any mandatory information that must be included?</h4></li>
<ul><li>With COVID-19, new social distancing measures would have to be put in
place due to the current Dallas city ordinance. Along with the requirement
of masks at the theatre.</ul></li>
<li><h4>List of deliverables? Preconceived ideas? Format parameters? Limitations and
restrictions? Timeline, schedule, budget?</h4></li>
<ul><li>Again with the new normal, COVID-19 would require patrons and
performers to wear masks and to social distance. Along with any
reduction of hours and make a way for tickets to any given show me
purchasable online on the official website.</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2>10. People</h2>

<li><h4>Who are we reporting to?</h4></li>
<ul><li>For the initial creation of the site, the owner of The Pocket Sandwich
Theatre for the final intended design and complete overhaul of the site.
Afterwards, the scheduling manager for any changes to the calendar.</li></ul>
