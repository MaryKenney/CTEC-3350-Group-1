        <h2>Project Background</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Client: </strong>Pocket Sandwhich Theatre</li>
                <li><strong>Product/ Service: </strong>Food and Entertainment. They’re an interactive, dine-in, live theatre. </li>
                <li><strong>SWOT: </strong><a href="swot.html">SWOT Analysis</a></li>
                <li><strong>Existing Research: </strong>No research is available at this point.</li>
                <li><strong>Date: </strong>September 22, 2020 </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Project Type: </strong>Website Redesign</li>
                <li><strong>Reason for Project: </strong>We’re redesigning the client’s website to update its layout, visuals, and links to make it up to date with current information and trends, as well as making it more functional and appealing to use. </li>
                <li><strong>Opportunities: </strong>There is a current trend of “vintage” that is attracting people to “older” types of entertainment. As such, there is a possibility of expanding the client’s reach to the younger generation. There is also a vast need for more "humanized" entertainment, while people are feeling isolated and out of contact with friends and family.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Drivers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Goals: </strong>Our goals are to modernize and stylize the Pocket Sandwich website in a way that not only draws in new customers, but also makes it easier for existing customers to use and gather information from. We want to give the company a cohesive aesthetic while still keeping true to the brand. Overall, our goal is to redesign the website over the course of 3 months, and, in the end, gain up to a 10% larger follower base within 6 months of the publishing date.</li>

                <li><strong>Top Three Objectives: </strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Modernize and completely overhaul the site and its visuals.</li>
                        <li>Create a working site for both desktop and mobile that retain features regardless of platform.</li>
                        <li>Bolster attention to The Pocket Sandwich Theatre with new and working website features.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Project Length: </strong>3 months.</li>
                <li><strong>Length of Time Until Goal is Achieved: </strong>Three months to modernize and redo the website, and 6 months to a year to gain a 10% larger follower base, depending on how well the Pocket Sandwich team markets and advertises their new website.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Audience</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Target Audience: </strong>
                    <ul>

                        <li><strong>Education: </strong>High School diploma.</li>
                        <li><strong>Technology Competency: </strong>Basic. Can navigate a website to find out information, and potentially order tickets or make reservations online.</li>
                        <li><strong>Race: </strong>Any race.</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>What do they think of us?</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pocket Sandwich Theatre is fun and offers good service and entertainment for the price. It’s enjoyable to come, eat there and watch the shows.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Why should they care about our project and products?</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pocket Sandwich Theatre is a family-friendly, one of a kind attraction, classical in the very verbiage of the word theatre. In the current monotonous state of the world during the tragedy that is COVID-19 we believe that Pocket Sandwich Theatre can provide a “new” but familiar way to experience both tragedy and comedy through the visceral escapism that is live theatre. Embrace tradition, reject modernity. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>What efforts could we duplicate from our competitors? </strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reasonable yet competitive forms of monetization in the form of ticket price and concessions.</li>
                        <li>Concessions and familiar showings of prominent and or classic acts of theatre.</li>
                        <li>An easy to use way to order tickets online and set reservations.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>What makes us unique from the competition?</strong>We’re interactive, fun and casual, we have award-winning shows and actors, and we pride ourselves in supporting local actors and playwrights. 
                </li>

            </ul>

        <h2>Tone</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What tone should we use to communicate to our target audience? Why? </strong>Our tone should be lighthearted and casual, but with just a touch of professionalism. We want to keep the overall theme of the theatre and its fun-oriented experience intact. However, we would also like to add a more professional tone as well to better convey that Pocket Sandwich is a legitimate business/ competition.</li>

                <li><strong>What adjectives describe the feeling we are trying to project on our approach?</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Impassioned</li>
                        <li>Fun-loving</li>
                        <li>Lighthearted</li>
                        <li>Friendly</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Message</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What message are we trying to convey with this site? </strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Our message is “come to Pocket Sandwich and you’ll have a fun, interactive time, watch an amazing show, and eat good food.” The feeling is developed and a lot of the words are there, but it needs to be developed into a cohesive message.
                        </li>
                        <li>We want our audience to take away that we’re a fun, rich in history theatre that has tasty food, entertaining shows, and will give them a more enjoyable experience than they can get anywhere else. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Is copyright provided by the client?</strong>Yes, however, recommendations can be made by us to improve the message.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Visuals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Are we developing new images or picking up existing ones?</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We can use old images in terms of what happens in the theatre, however, when it comes to vector art and design outside the realm of photography we may have to update the very dated design.</li>
                        <li>We would take brand new pictures in the theatre with guests using new disease preventative measures. With graphic design we will create new logos, banners, and icons for the site.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Details</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What information on the site must be included? </strong>With COVID-19, new social distancing measures would have to be put in place due to the current Dallas city ordinance. We would also need to include mask guidelines for performers and guests, updated hours, and the ability to purchase tickets online.</li>

                <li><strong>Limitations and Restrictions: </strong>We are restricted to a brief, 3 month timeline, and we are limited in terms of Javascript and PHP resources.</li>

                <li><strong>List of Deliverables: </strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reformatted, streamlined website navigation.</li>
                        <li>Restructed, more aesthetically pleasing web pages.</li>

                </li>
            </ul>
