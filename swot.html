                                    <li>There’s a lot of important information, especially on the home page and in the “fun stuff” section. They have all the tabs needed to convey the information that they want to display, it just needs to be reorganized to convey it better. </li>

                                    <li>We could highlight show clips, awards, and the fun traditions of the theatre in order to emphasize its rich history and fun, interactive nature. </li>

                                    <li>Pocket Sandwich is best known for being Dallas’ last standing dinner theatre. They’re very community forward, consistently supporting and employing local artists. They also have an incredibly rich history of over 40 years of shows (300+) and fun traditions such as interactive plays. </li>
                                  </ul>

                                  <ul>
                                    <li>The site in general is sort of a jumbled mess in terms of aesthetic and outdated design. No color scheme or theme that has a hint of consistency at all.  The main menu on the homepage glitches out and makes the user unable to click it. Gallery images show no type of significant information or are able to draw the user in easily. 
                                    </li>
                                  </ul>

                                  <ul>
                                    <li>The main menu simply does not work, and if you go to another page on the site, there is no way of going back to the homepage. Only the Facebook page social link works, all the others are non-interactive and seem incomplete. Gallery arrows do not make sense in which way they intend to go. </li>
                                  </ul>
                                </li>

                                    <li>Having the social links that work, along with new and current social media for marketing. Creating a functional calendar for desktop. Overall create a presence of modern web design. </li>
                                  </ul>

                                    <li>With the novel COVID-19, I think it should be important for any business that wants to operate in the “new normal” to tell any possible customer or performer of any guidelines for a safe stay at a public venue. Along with the emergence of old types of viewing cinema/theater (i.e.: drive-in movies), we believe that it would be a good chance to capitalize on the current trend.
                                    </li>
                                  </ul>

                                  <ul>
                                    <li>With COVID-19 most drastically affecting the older population, who are a large clientele for theatres in general, the target audience may shift towards the younger generation who are eager to get outside and do stuff after long periods of quarantine.  
                                    </li>
                                  </ul>

                                    <li>Interactive maps, along with online ticket and reservation sales could boost business once the theatre is able to reopen. </li>

                                  <ul>
                                    <li>The popularity of dinner theaters in general is declining, which is something to consider in the long run once trends pass.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>People may be more attracted to other businesses in the area; the theater itself provides food as one of its services, but there are other food options in the area so the theater may lose profit in that category. </li>
                                  </ul>

                                    <li>The location of the theater doesn’t stand out or attract any special attention and could be easy to miss. It doesn’t help that the theater shares a building with various other businesses, and thus the signs are all grouped together. 
                                    </li>

                                    <li>COVID-19 has affected current theater operations, which means there hasn’t been a chance to advertise and attract new clients and has slowed any potential business growth</li>
